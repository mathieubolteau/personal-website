abstract = {Abstract Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) are efficient engineered tools for delivering genetic material into host cells. The commercialization of AAV-based drugs must be accompanied by the development of appropriate quality control (QC) assays. Given the potential risk of co-transfer of oncogenic or immunogenic sequences with therapeutic vectors, accurate methods to assess the level of residual DNA in AAV vector stocks are particularly important. An assay based on high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to identify and quantify DNA species in recombinant AAV batches is developed. Here, it is shown that PCR amplification of regions that have a local GC content >90\% and include successive mononucleotide stretches, such as the CAG promoter, can introduce bias during DNA library preparation, leading to drops in sequencing coverage. To circumvent this problem, SSV-Seq 2.0, a PCR-free protocol for sequencing AAV vector genomes containing such sequences, is developed. The PCR-free protocol improves the evenness of the rAAV genome coverage and consequently leads to a more accurate relative quantification of residual DNA. HTS-based assays provide a more comprehensive assessment of DNA impurities and AAV vector genome integrity than conventional QC tests based on real-time PCR and are useful methods to improve the safety and efficacy of these viral vectors.},

  abstract = {The impact of a perturbation, over-expression, or repression of a key node on an organism, can be modelled based on a regulatory and/or metabolic network. Integration of these two networks could improve our global understanding of biological mechanisms triggered by a perturbation. This study focuses on improving the modelling of the regulatory network to facilitate a possible integration with the metabolic network. Previously proposed methods that study this problem fail to deal with a real-size regulatory network, computing predictions sensitive to perturbation and quantifying the predicted species behaviour more finely.},

  abstract  = {This study aims to understand human embryonic development and cell fate determination, specifically in relation to trophectoderm (TE) maturation. We utilize single-cell transcriptomics (scRNAseq) data to develop a framework for inferring computational models that distinguish between two developmental stages. Our method selects pseudo-perturbations from scRNAseq data since actual perturbations are impractical due to ethical and legal constraints. These pseudo-perturbations consist of input-output discretized expressions, for a limited set of genes and cells. By combining these pseudo-perturbations with prior-regulatory networks, we can infer Boolean networks that accurately align with scRNAseq data for each developmental stage. Our publicly available method was tested with several benchmarks, proving the feasibility of our approach. Applied to the real dataset, we infer Boolean network families, corresponding to the medium and late TE developmental stages. Their structures reveal contrasting regulatory pathways, offering valuable biological insights and hypotheses within this domain.},
