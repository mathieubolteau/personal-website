abstract = {Abstract Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) are efficient engineered tools for delivering genetic material into host cells. The commercialization of AAV-based drugs must be accompanied by the development of appropriate quality control (QC) assays. Given the potential risk of co-transfer of oncogenic or immunogenic sequences with therapeutic vectors, accurate methods to assess the level of residual DNA in AAV vector stocks are particularly important. An assay based on high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to identify and quantify DNA species in recombinant AAV batches is developed. Here, it is shown that PCR amplification of regions that have a local GC content >90\% and include successive mononucleotide stretches, such as the CAG promoter, can introduce bias during DNA library preparation, leading to drops in sequencing coverage. To circumvent this problem, SSV-Seq 2.0, a PCR-free protocol for sequencing AAV vector genomes containing such sequences, is developed. The PCR-free protocol improves the evenness of the rAAV genome coverage and consequently leads to a more accurate relative quantification of residual DNA. HTS-based assays provide a more comprehensive assessment of DNA impurities and AAV vector genome integrity than conventional QC tests based on real-time PCR and are useful methods to improve the safety and efficacy of these viral vectors.},
