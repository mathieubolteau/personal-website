<p style='text-align: justify;'>I am currently a Ph.D. student in computational biology at the University of Nantes, **working on the modeling of human preimplantation development**. My research interests lie in various areas of biology and computer science, especially **systems biology**. I am also the **president of LOGIN**, the association of young researchers in digital science of Nantes, which brings together mainly Ph.D. students.</p>
