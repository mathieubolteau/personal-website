> Title: Logic programs to infer computational models of human embryonic development<br/> Assisted reproductive technologies, and in particular in vitro fertilization (IVF), need new approaches to improve clinical outcomes of infertility treatments. The success rate of IVF cycles is only 25%. Despite promising technologies to consider each individual embryo, research on human embryos is too limited to systematically test hypothesis-driven research. Therefore, an essential aspect is to be able to generate a computational model of preimplantation development that will predict the impact of perturbations on the system. The objective of this thesis is to write logic programs and use state-of-the-art solvers to find models describing human embryonic cells and their development over time.
