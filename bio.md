<u>Title</u>: Logic programs to infer computational models of human embryonic development
Under the supervision of [Jérémie Bourdon](http://jeremiebourdon.free.fr/wiki.php/Accueil) (LS2N), Carito Guziowloski (LS2N) and Laurent David (CR2TI).
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Assisted reproductive technologies, and in particular in vitro fertilization (IVF), need new approaches to improve clinical outcomes of infertility treatments. The success rate of IVF cycles is only 25%. Despite promising technologies to consider each individual embryo, research on human embryos is too limited to systematically test hypothesis-driven research. Therefore, an essential aspect is to be able to generate a computational model of preimplantation development that will predict the impact of perturbations on the system. The objective of this thesis is to write logic programs and use state-of-the-art solvers to find models describing human embryonic cells and their development over time.</p>
